Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My research on local politics explores how policies influence participation and representation across various local contexts. In particular, I focus on what motivates individuals to reach out to their local governments and what governments can do to mobilize traditionally underrepresented groups. I utilize machine learning and advances in political methodology to examine participation and public opinion across the contexts of city, school board, and county governments. I also have recent interests in the Supreme Court, Corporate Political Behavior, and Interest Group Networks. Please feel free to contact me by email!
